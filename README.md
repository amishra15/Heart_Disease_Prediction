# Heart_Disease_Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning models. I have conducted an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data better and identify key factors associated with heart disease. After exploring various models, the Decision Tree algorithm provided the highest accuracy.

## Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive analysis to understand the relationships and patterns in the data.
- Machine Learning Model: Used Decision Tree model which achieved an accuracy of 96%, ensuring careful handling to avoid overfitting.
- Model Deployment: Deployed the model using Flask, making it accessible as a web application.

## Model Deployment
The model is deployed using Flask. This allows users to input their data and receive predictions through a simple web interface.

## The Decision Tree model performed exceptionally well, achieving an accuracy of 96%. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting heart disease effectively.
